## Completed Tasks

### 2024-01-XX - Critical Bug Fixes for Milestone-Based Crowdfunding System
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Fixed three critical issues that broke the intended logic and flow for the milestone-based crowdfunding system

#### Fix 1: Implemented Milestone Validation and Withdrawal Logic
- ✅ Added new error variants: `MilestoneInvalidSequence`, `MilestoneAlreadyCompleted`, `WithdrawalAmountZero`
- ✅ Created `validate_milestone` function in `contracts/trace/src/methods/milestones/validate_milestone.rs`
- ✅ Created `withdraw` function in `contracts/trace/src/methods/campaign/withdraw.rs`
- ✅ Added `has_proof` function to proof storage module
- ✅ Updated contract trait and implementation to expose new functions
- ✅ Implemented sequential milestone validation with admin authorization
- ✅ Added proper fund release calculation and withdrawable amount tracking

#### Fix 2: Corrected Inconsistent Storage Usage
- ✅ Fixed `get_campaign` function to use `persistent` storage instead of `instance` storage
- ✅ Fixed `set_proof` and `get_proof` functions to use `persistent` storage consistently
- ✅ Ensured all state that needs to survive beyond single transactions uses persistent storage

#### Fix 3: Cleaned Up Refund Function Signature
- ✅ Removed unused `amount` parameter from `refund` function in contract trait
- ✅ Updated contract implementation to match the actual refund logic (full refunds only)
- ✅ Aligned public interface with internal implementation

**Impact**: 
- Campaign owners can now properly withdraw funds after milestone completion
- All contributed funds are no longer permanently locked in the contract
- Storage operations work correctly and state persists between transactions
- Function signatures accurately represent their behavior

- `contracts/trace/src/methods/campaign/withdraw.rs` - New file
- `contracts/trace/src/methods/campaign/mod.rs` - Added module export
- `contracts/trace/src/storage/proof.rs` - Fixed storage consistency + added has_proof
- `contracts/trace/src/storage/campaign.rs` - Fixed storage consistency
- `contracts/trace/src/contract_trait.rs` - Added new functions, fixed refund signature
- `contracts/trace/src/contract.rs` - Updated implementation, removed stub
